    tiny_description: A lightweight habit-forming journal for your new tab page.
    intro: pygmy is aimed at those who have always wanted to keep a journal, but have trouble starting and maintaining the habit. This was a self-driven project of mine. I was responsible for all user research/testing, design and development.

        -   text: <h2>Background</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>A journal has always been a simple yet powerful tool to gain a better sense of one's life. When I decided to try keeping one, I always ran into the problem of commitment issues and anxiety. Struggling with the thought of whether or not what I was writing was worth being an entry for the day. I would also frequently forget to write that day and then have to write up backlogs of entries to get out of some odd self-imposed "diary debt".</p>

            breakout: research-breakout.jpg
            breakout_text: Many people tend to use pen and paper, others might just use their iPhone notes app. A private tumblr blog or twitter could be a journal. At the core of it, journaling is just writing. Many journaling apps suffer from feature-creeping on top of such a simple concept. From what I found, I didn't find an adequately executed solution for my needs. I figured this had a space in the landscape. 
        -   text: <h2>Viability</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>As much as I wanted to make something for myself, I mainly wanted to figure out what other people needed. I sought out to see if this was a problem that others faced as well. I spent time talking writing down my own motivations and habits as well as those of my friends and family. After our conversations, I had a few hypotheses and assumptions that I wanted to get data on for before thinking of a solution. So I drafted a <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/do/bd3be562e1af/cbcb" target="_blank">short survey</a> to get a better sense of other people's thoughts. <br><br>The assumptions I wanted to validate were that people:</p> <ul><li>Generally have an interest in journaling</li><li>Feel intimidated by the idea of starting</li><li>Use journals as a means to self-reflect</li></ul><p>With these assumptions cleared, I would be able to have a better foundation to base my decisions on.</p>

            caption: A few charts of the questions asked.
            text: <p>I circulated the survey to friends who passed it on to their friends, followers on social media and Usability Hub's survey community. From these results I was able to paint a general picture of what was needed. Referring back to the earlier assumptions:</p><ul><li>Generally have an interest in journaling<ul><li>87% showed interest in keeping a journal but 63% say they've currently or never have kept one. This made habit building a main goal of the design.</li></ul></li><li>Feel intimidated by the idea of starting<ul><li>Half of people surveyed agreed with this sentiment which was enough for me to keep it in mind while designing. Among other things, this helped me keep the design simple and the aesthetic welcoming.</li></ul></li><li>Use journals as a means to self-reflect<ul><li>69% of people listed self-reflection as a motivation for keeping a journal. Along with reminiscing(67%) and record collection(65%). This influenced the decision and execution of archiving and searching journal entries.</li></ul></li></ul><p>A full set of results can be found <a href="https://app.usabilityhub.com/tests/bd3be562e1af/results/999d28a5919b" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            breakout: pygmy-sketches.jpg
            breakout_text: After gathering some data and sitting with it for a bit, I went ahead and sketched some higher-level flows. Which then followed a cycle of ideation and sketching until I was comfortable with a design to flesh out. <br><br>Some of my ideas along with the most recent execution can be found <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/O30ofmvnIhV8RxQL3a4BpzyS/beachside?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">here</a>.
        -   text: <h2>Aesthetic</h2><p>I wanted to have fun with this project and introduce color in meaningful and intentional ways, all while keeping it subtle enough to reduce distraction.<br><br>Type and iconography contrast and legibility was a high priority. In addition, accessibility options for text size and further contrast are provided to ensure a pleasurable experience for everyone.</p>

    tiny_description: A structured thread based messaging client made for organizing and accessing conversations.
    intro: Decorum is a revisited look into structured, hierarchical communication for those looking to easily, circulate, retrieve and archive information. Think the tree-structure of a forum with the familiarity of a chat client. I'm responsible for all design and research while working with developers building the product.

        -   image: my-friends-talk-too-much.jpg
            caption: Our slack group talks a lot...
            text: <h2>The Problem</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Decorum is trying to occupy an odd space. Imagine you and 10 of your friends are talking in a group chat about a topic. Frequently, talking about a topic devolves into talking about related subtopics. We defined this as "cross-talk". Cross-talk derails and makes a conversation difficult to keep up with. Especially when you're reading the conversation after the fact. Other solutions like Slack have tried adding threads to keep conversations organized, but Slack threads can get lost, aren't divisible and are generally not friendly for discussions longer than a few lines.</p><p>Additionally, If you use something like Slack or Email you're expected to answer right away, or at least it feels that way. This makes communication platforms addicting, even pressuring to use. We want Decorum to take that feeling away, so that you're pulling actionable items instead of being pushed them. This way you can focus on what you need to do.</p>
        -   text: <h2>Who's it for?</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Decorum is mainly for smaller groups of people. Groups of people who are looking for structure in their communication.</p><p>Examples would be, niche hobby communities, teams within an organization, large friend groups, research groups or clubs. </p>
        -   text: <h2>What does success look like?</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>We want Decorum to be a product people get satisfaction out of using. This also means helping people to feel empowered to talk on their own and not be burdened by pressures to use a platform.</p><p>So to help alleviate these issues, our main goals for the product are to be:</p><ul><li>organized, sort of like email.</li><li>approachable, sort of like a chat client.</li><li>asynchronous, sort of like a forum.</li></ul><p>From the research we've done, nothing like this exists.</p><br>

            caption: A very early initial brainstorm of Decorum.
            text: <h2>Process</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>A great amount of effort went into defining the problem. At first we thought we knew what we wanted, we assumed communication was a pretty straightfoward problem. However, after a bunch of prototypes and ideas we couldn't quite see a clear picture to a solution. So after a lot of discussion we were able to distill what we wanted into a certain feeling we want Decorum to achieve.</p><p>We view a chat client akin to being in a room with friends, actively being present in a discussion. We want Decorum to feel like sitting in the park with a community of people you're familiar with. Being able to feel present, but also not necessarily needing to feel involved. </p><p>My friends and I find this feeling in social centers of old school MMORPGs or old community BBS forums. It's this feeling of being able to have a high level presence of a community while also feeling no pressure to jump into and out of a conversation. </p><p>Check out some of the ideas we've gone through so far:</p>

The widgets themselves also had the ability to be placed anywhere within a grid based system that organized the placement of the widgets. Widgets could follow a 2x2, 2x1 or 1x1 size within the grid system, these units being user specified as well.</p><br><br>

            text: <p>Initially, the purpose of this project was to create an OS and browser agnostic way to allow users to have a high level of customization for their homepage. Although, the applications for the project extend past this initial purpose. We began to realize that this could be brought to other levels of user needs. For example, on an enterprise level, companies can make their own homepage with company branding, create widgets to fit the needs of their employees and deliver a company branded homepage to all browsers, regardless of operating system.</p><br><br>
