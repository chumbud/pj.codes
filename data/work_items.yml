            breakout: research-breakout.jpg
            breakout_text: Many people tend to use pen and paper, others might just use their iPhone notes app. A private tumblr blog or twitter could be a journal. At the core of it, journaling is just writing. Many journaling apps suffer from feature-creeping on top of such a simple concept. From what I found, I didn't find an adequately executed solution for my needs. I figured this had a space in the landscape.

    tiny_description: A structured thread based messaging client made for organizing and accessing conversations.
    intro: Decorum is a revisited look into structured, hierarchical communication for those looking to easily, circulate, retrieve and archive information. Think the tree-structure of a forum with the familiarity of a chat client.

            caption: Our slack group talks a lot...
            text: <h2>The Problem</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Decorum is trying to occupy an odd space. Imagine you and 10 of your friends are talking in a group chat about a topic. Frequently, talking about a topic devolves into talking about related subtopics. We defined this as "cross-talk". Cross-talk derails and makes a conversation difficult to keep up with. Especially when you're reading the conversation after the fact. Other solutions like Slack have tried adding threads to keep conversations organized, but Slack threads can get lost, aren't divisible and are generally not friendly for discussions longer than a few lines.</p><p>Additionally, If you use something like Slack or Email you're expected to answer right away, or at least it feels that way. This makes communication platforms addicting, even pressuring to use. We want Decorum to take that feeling away, so that you're pulling actionable items instead of being pushed them. This way you can focus on what you need to do.</p>
        -   text: <h2>Who's it for?</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Decorum is mainly for smaller groups of people. Groups of people who are looking for structure in their communication.</p><p>Examples would be, niche hobby communities, teams within an organization, large friend groups, research groups or clubs. </p>
        -   text: <h2>What does success look like?</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>We want Decorum to be a product people get satisfaction out of using. This also means helping people to feel empowered to talk on their own and not be burdened by pressures to use a platform.</p><p>So to help alleviate these issues, our main goals for the product are to be:</p><ul><li>organized, sort of like email.</li><li>approachable, sort of like a chat client.</li><li>asynchronous, sort of like a forum.</li></ul><p>From the research we've done, nothing like this exists.</p><br>

            caption: A very early initial brainstorm of Decorum.
            text: <h2>Process</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>A great amount of effort went into defining the problem. At first we thought we knew what we wanted, we assumed communication was a pretty straightfoward problem. However, after a bunch of prototypes and ideas we couldn't quite see a clear picture to a solution. So after a lot of discussion we were able to distill what we wanted into a certain feeling we want Decorum to achieve.</p><p>We view a chat client akin to being in a room with friends, actively being present in a discussion. We want Decorum to feel like sitting in the park with a community of people you're familiar with. Being able to feel present, but also not necessarily needing to feel involved. </p><p>My friends and I find this feeling in social centers of old school MMORPGs or old community BBS forums. It's this feeling of being able to have a high level presence of a community while also feeling no pressure to jump into and out of a conversation. </p><p>Check out some of the ideas we've gone through so far:</p>

        -   text: <h2>What we do</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Belonging to a small team of designers, we're tasked with transferring the brand voice of VH1 and Logo on-air content to the digital space through its social media and websites. The nature of this work varied heavily from project to project. One project could be creating a full social campaign to publicize an upcoming show or making animated instagram posts for an initiative the network is pushing. Another would be building a <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/the-breaks/interactive-map" arget="_blank">web app</a> that viewers could engage with that supplements a show's content. We also have created prototypes of our networks' sites for our product teams to implement more accurate styling to new pages and features.</p><p>Since the type of work we do changes frequently, we're molded to be a sort of in-house agency for our networks with a well-rounded set of talents.</p>

This included that I created the design of the website, logo, stickers, t-shirts and everything else that faced the hacker as they experienced HackRU. Every semester the marketing team and I collaborated on the theme of the semester and built a look and feel to accompany it.</p>

    tiny_description: A lightweight browser agnostic dashboard for your new-tab page. Made during UPenn's 36-hour hackathon.
    intro: A modular, grid based homepage consisting of widgets that are highly customizable. Created with a team of two other developers at the 36-hour hackathon, PennApps Fall 2015.

        -   text: <p>By the end of the hackathon, my team and I had delivered a prototype with a few functional widgets and working customization functions. The prototype allowed for color customizability of widget UI and custom backgrounds. The widgets themselves also had the ability to be placed anywhere within a grid based system that organized the placement of the widgets. Widgets could follow a 2x2, 2x1 or 1x1 size within the grid system, these units being user specified as well.</p><br><br>
        -   image: anchorage-panel.jpg
            text: <p>Initially, the purpose of this project was to create an OS and browser agnostic way to allow users to have a high level of customization for their homepage. Although, the applications for the project extend past this initial purpose. We began to realize that this could be brought to other levels of user needs. For example, on an enterprise level, companies can make their own homepage with company branding, create widgets to fit the needs of their employees and deliver a company branded homepage to all browsers, regardless of operating system.</p><br><br>
