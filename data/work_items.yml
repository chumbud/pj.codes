    tiny_description: A thread based messaging client made for organizing and accessing conversations.
    intro: Messaging typically is a single pipeline of information being exchanged back-and-forth. Other messaging clients offer features to create extra spaces where these communications can be categorized. However, when in the moment of conversation with multiple people, this conversation can't be split into multiple discussions. Keeping track of these conversations in one stream is difficult, especially for archival purposes. This is where Decorum seeks to offer a solution.

        -   text: <p>Our friend group spends talks to each other daily through Slack. We have our Slack channels that we used to keep our conversations relevant, but even then we'd find ourselves talking over each other from multiple conversations taking place in a single channel.</p><p>This is when one of our friends started working on an MVP for a side-project to try to help that which is how this project was started.</p><p>After showing me and a few other friends the MVP and pitching us the idea, we were totally on board to help him.</p><h2>The Problem</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Essentially, what we wanted to try to offer was a way to branch discussions into their own spaces so that a certain organization could be maintained in a conversation with many participants. </p>

            caption: A very early initial brainstorm of Decorum.
        -   text: <h2>Process</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>From a product standpoint, the problem that had to be solved was creating a means to handle multi-threaded conversations and organizing them. Then integrating that solution into a tradition chat interface. I wish I saved some of the original sketches, instead I have some of the original Figma mocks of some early prototypes. </p>

        -   text: <h2>Future Challenges</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>The current design is obviously subject to change since this project still is under development. For the future we foresee some challenges that will need to taken care of as we reevaluate later builds. These include:</p><ul><li>Thread pruning</li><li>Adding context messages to new threads</li><li>Thread organization/reorganization</li><li>Additional thread levels</li><li>Account management</li></ul>
        -   text: <h2>Where we are</h2><div class="divider"></div><p>Currently, Decorum is being developed our spare time. Since we're now past prototyping, the product is being built and slated for release sometime next year.</p>

    tiny_description: A lightweight browser agnostic dashboard for your new-tab page. Made during UPenn's 36-hour hackathon.
    intro: A modular, grid based homepage consisting of widgets that are highly customizable. Created with a team of two other developers at the 36-hour hackathon, PennApps Fall 2015.
    sections:
        -   image: anchorage-widgets.png
        -   text: <p>By the end of the hackathon, my team and I had delivered a prototype with a few functional widgets and working customization functions. The prototype allowed for color customizability of widget UI and custom backgrounds. The widgets themselves also had the ability to be placed anywhere within a grid based system that organized the placement of the widgets. Widgets could follow a 2x2, 2x1 or 1x1 size within the grid system, these units being user specified as well.</p><p>Initially, the purpose of this project was to create an OS and browser agnostic way to allow users to have a high level of customization for their homepage. Although, the applications for the project extend past this initial purpose. We began to realize that this could be brought to other levels of user needs. For example, on an enterprise level, companies can make their own homepage with company branding, create widgets to fit the needs of their employees and deliver a company branded homepage to all browsers, regardless of operating system.</p><p>Currently, Anchorage is being polished and developed for an initial release into the Chrome Web Store as a Chrome extension. </p>
